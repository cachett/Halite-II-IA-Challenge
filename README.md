My deeplearning bot using keras and tensorflow for the programming competition Halite II. This bot reached rank 120 out of 5500.

The idea of the evolutive learning is to learn out of random. I create training data by making two random bot fight against each other and then select the decision of the winner which shloud be better in average than the decision of the looser. Then I train a multi layer perceptron with this data.
